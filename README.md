E-commerce Website for Meeraai Tech Solution
During my 5-month internship at Meeraai Tech Solution, I developed a feature-rich E-commerce Website for Clothing Branding, focusing on delivering a seamless user experience and robust functionality. The project involved designing and implementing the following core features:

Responsive Product Listings: Created visually appealing product pages with intuitive navigation, filter, and sort options to enhance user browsing.
Secure User Authentication: Implemented secure login and registration functionality to protect user data, ensuring smooth account management.
Shopping Cart & Payment Integration: Developed a fully functional shopping cart with real-time updates and integrated a secure payment gateway to facilitate seamless transactions.
Order Management System: Enabled users to track order status, view order history, and manage their purchases efficiently.
Admin Dashboard: Designed a comprehensive admin panel to allow seamless product management, order tracking, and user management.
Throughout the project, I prioritized responsive design principles to ensure a consistent experience across devices. I also applied modern UI/UX techniques to improve user engagement and interaction. This project enhanced my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and UI/UX design, contributing significantly to my growth as a full-stack developer.
